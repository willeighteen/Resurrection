There is no harmonic modelling, just different frequency amplitude 
modelling applied to separate note phases, the decay and sustain. This is 
simply an example of note phase selection, illustrating the point that 
successive terrain layers can be applied to the formation of the note.

The available phase codes are:

0	; (default) whole note
1	; attack
2	; decline or decaycy+sustain+release
	; if giusrdclphs is set:
3	; decay
4	; sustain
5	; release
6	; decay+sustain
7	; sustain+release
