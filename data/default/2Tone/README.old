Hangover from resurrection-17.4.x and previous; needs rewrite for R5


In instrument 43 set:

	gi1aEnvPhase = 0
	gi2aEnvPhase = 0
	; nonzero terrainFn num overrides table shaping of terrain
	giterrainFn1a = 1
	giterrainFn2a = 0
	giTerrainMode1a = 0
	giTerrainMode2a = 1

Copy the *Params files to the relevant data<instr> directory or set the path
to these in the instrument <instr>.terrain file (or whatever it is named).

Terrain layer 1 is produced by a mathematical expression, specified by 
number; several types will be available and more can be specified.

A pair of increasing linear indices with range [0,1] (table 201) are used 
to construct the z plane directly, instead of referencing a table whose 
values are then used in the z-plane calculation. The toplevel (surface) 
function table specified in the orbit parameter files is ignored since a 
nonzero function number is specified in the instrument setup. To emphasise 
this, the toplevel x and y surface tables are specified as constant zero 
(table 246).
