Using higher analysis sample rate to achieve detail in atk/dcl whilst removing majority of sustain phase.

Make copy of atk region, find max sample value 0.542494s, cut thereafter from after next zero-crossing.
atk dur 0.545601s

Make copy of dcl region after note vibrato subsides, find maxamp location, cut to zero before this.
dcl dur 0.493968s

composite AltoFlute.ff.A3.AD

there is now a disjuncture in amplitude levels

max vol 3k (should these be normalised?
