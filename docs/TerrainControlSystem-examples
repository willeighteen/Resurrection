0:
The above is the minimum necessary to define a terrain axis component and
associated orbit component. The surface function is 201, a linear table with
range [0,1]. The index function (a sine with range [-1,1]) points to the position
in the terrain axis function to be used as the amplitude modulation axis
component value for some harmonic(s). In this example the modulation is
applied to all harmonics, so they all vary at the same rate and by the same
amount.

3:
The index magnitude scalar (ixmagmag) is const. 1, returning the value of  the
function specified in the index magnitude tbl (ixmagtbl) with no index magnitude
table offset (ixmagoff). Since the table specified (247) returns 1 whatever the
value of the index, the resulting index magnitude is 1x1+0 = 1.

This index scalar is applied to the value of the toplevel index table ixtbl, which has
range 0,1] so the index values are unmodified. The index thus moves in a sine
from 0 to 1 to -1 and back to 0.

5:

Line 1	1	0	247	ixsp mag, ixsp  off,  ixsp tbl

The index table scan period magnitude ixspmag (1) scales the value
returned by the index scan period table ixsptbl; no offset is added to
the index table scan period magnitude (ixspoff = 0).

Line 2	0	0	246	ixsp ix mag, ixsp ix off, ixsp ix tbl

This line controls the indexing of the index scan period table in line 1 (ixsptbl).
The ixspixtbl is scanned at a frequency determined in line 3. Since the magnitude
here is zero, the offset ixspixoff is zero and the ixspixtbl returns const. 0 (table
246), the resulting index is fixed at 0 x const. 0 + 0 = 0. This indexes the index
scan period table which latter consequently returns const. 1.

Line 3	0	0	0	0	ixsp tbl off, ixsp tbl wrap, ixsp ix tbl scan period, scan period flag

There is no offset to the index scan period table, there is no index scan 
period table wrap and the ixsp ixsp is 0. Since the index returned is const. 0  the
lack of a specified scan period is irrelevant.

The index scan period index scan period magnitude ixspmag is 1, scaling the
output of its associated table ixsptbl, which returns const. 1. The toplevel index
table scan period is determined by these values, hence is also 1.

Scan periods n > 0 are interpreted as n/notephasedur, governing the number of
repeats. Scan periods n < 0 are interpreted as a repetition frequency of n Hz.

Notes.

X axis terrain component

0:
x axis function linear increasing (0->1, table 201)
x axis index function cosine (table 220)

1:
x axis table output magnitude 1 - this scales the output from the magnitude
table (247) which just returns constant unity.

2:
No offset to magnitude; since the magnitude scalar is zero the other fields are
irrelevant and have no effect.

3:
Index magnitude scalar is 0.25, which value is constant (this scalar modifies the
value returned from the associate magnitude table, 247, which is constant unity).
The index range is therefore [-0.25, 0.25].

4:
Index offset magnitude scalar 0.5; since the magnitude table for this parameter
is constant unity (247), a constant value of 0.5 results for the offset. This is added
to the index value returned by the toplevel index function, a cosine, after its scaling
in sec. 3. (above). Since the index range of the cosine table is 1 (i.e. it has range
[-1, 1]), the scaling 0.25 and subsequent addition of 0.5 (itself constant since its
associated maginutde table is const. unity, 247 and this value is a scalar of this
table value) is a cosine index centred at 0.5 with range [0.25, 0.75], hence is
now entirely positive.

5:
Index scan period 1. Resurrection interprets this as 1/notephasedur - the reci[procal
of the fduration of the note phase to which the terrain modelling is applied. If
this value is negative, it is interpreted as a frequency in Hz. Here the index table
is scanned once over the note phase duration, so if the selected phase is the
whole note, then the index varies in a cosine pattern over this period with values
ranging from 0.25 to 0.75. Note again the magnitude of 1 is a scalar of the
associated magnitude table value, here const. unity (247), so the value is always
1 regardless of its associated index.


It should be further noted that since all the above magnitude parameters are
constant, the index value to their magnitude tables is set to zero (const. 0 is
returned by table 246), as shown by the second line of each of the five sections
above.

The index to the magnitude table in the above 5 cases is therefore zero and the
first value in the magnitude table is always returned (zero).


Y axis terrain component

The y axis component of the terrain is exactly the same as that of the x axis, the
only difference being in the index table specification, here a sine (table 239).

The index has range [0.25, 0.75] and the surface table is increasing linear, so
the output is a sine with range [0.25, 0.75] with centre 0.5


Terrain

The product of these terrain axis components, f(x)*f(y), is therefore a circle of
radius 0.5 with centre at (0.5, 0.5), reflecting the circularity of the combined
index functions.

It should be noted that these indices are not offset to the start of a particular
phase of the note, but begin with their initial values at the commencement of
the note. The effect during a particular phase may not be what was intended
unless offsets are applied so the functions' initial values are what is to be
expected at the commencement of the selected phase. The frequency of
repetition of the circle represented by the indices is, however, of the _duration_
of the selected phase, so the relationship is still valid. The expected result may
be obtained by using the whole note for the selected region. Although an offset
to the indices may be applied to displace their values, only an approximate
match to a sub-whole-note phase can be obtained since this latter will vary
according to the note duration, frequency and amplitude.

Since the rate of increase in the surface functions is linear and both increase at
the same rate, the surface traversed by the circle is curved. The program
'gnuplot' may be used to view this surface using the commands

gnuplot
(to invoke gnuplot)

gnuplot> set isosamples 35
gnuplot> set hidden3d
gnuplot> set xrange [0:1]
gnuplot> set yrange [0:1]
gnuplot> splot x*y

The mouse may be used to rotate the view.

It should be note that the above is a specific case of an elliptical orbit where the
magnitudes of the x and y index components are the same. If the magnitudes of
the index are unequal, the result will be an ellipse.

A phasor table with range [-1,1] is scaled by factor 10 once over the note duration,
producing an x index of range [0,10]. Noting that the z range is  within
[-0.21, 1] and the centre of this at 0.605, whereas we require the average
harmonic level to be 1 (the default): 1-0.605 = 0.395 which offset is used to centre
the variations in terrain height about 1.

The index produced by group 4, b, ii is a constant 0.2 scaled by the product of
the harmonic index factor (group 4 dynamic controls, item 3) and the harmonic
number plus one (which avoids nullifying the index for harmonic 0). The result is
a series of integer harmonic numbers 1,2,3,... which scale the constant 0.2 offset
to produce index values 0.2, 0.4,...

These values are used as the index to the index offset table which produces an
output of range [0, 1] (group 4, a, iii, table 201). Since the index values start at
0.2 and exceed 1 if the harmonic number is greater than 5, the table wrap mode
is set and a table offset of 0.8 applied (group 4, c, ii and i), so the first index
value, 0.2, is wrapped around to zero to make this the series starting point.

The resulting index has range [0,1] and increments in steps of 0.2, thus
repeating every 5 harmonics.

These index values are scaled and offset by 10 and 3 (group 4, a, i and ii) to
produce final values of range [3, 11] with increment 10*0.2 = 2. These are used
as the y values in evaluation of the Sombrero function (1).

Note that the final index is actually an index offset produced by group 4; the index
(group 3) is unused.

Note also the value 1 for the group 4 link flag; this could just as easily have been
2 or 3 since the magnitude of the amp/frq output (link group 4, b) is zero. Only the
harmonic number is used for dynamic control (group 4, c).

The values indicated for group 4 (index offset) might just as well have been
used to directly generate an index via group 3. In this case the group 3 default
parameters are replaced by those of group 4. The top-level index table
(group 0, b) , which is unused by group 4, is required for group 3, and therefore
its value is set to constant unity (table 247), thus scaling the index produced
by const. 1. The group 3 dynamic link entries must be changed to reflect those of
group 4 (which can now be nulled):

copy the group 4 parameters to group 3 and those of group 5 (null) to group 4.
copy the group 4 dynamic links to group 3 and those of group 5 (null) to group 4.

This approach frees the group 4 entries for more detailed control, since the
index values generated by group 3 can now themselves be controlled by a
variable offset supplied by group 4.

The group 0 magnitude, unused since the surface table is replaced by a function,
is used to scale the function output values (here it returns const. 1, the product
of the magnitude and magnitude table values, which scales the final surface (z)
value.

We define the index magnitude in group 3. A harmonic scaling factor of 1 is linked
to the (constant) index magnitude index offset (group 3, b, ii) of 0.5; this
produces a series starting at 0.5 and incrementing by 0.5 for each harmonic
(x axis variable ixmagix).
This indexes the wrapped index magnitude table 201 (group 3, a, iii) which returns
an alternating 0.5/0 index magnitude. These values are scaled by 0.1 and then
have an 0.95 offset added. This produces index magnitudes of 1 and
0.95 for successive harmonics.

Setting the requirement the the max number of harmonics (100) should use the
whole set of exponential table values, we require that an index offset of -0.01 per
harmonic be added to the index value (group 3, above).

This is generated in group 4. A constant index value of 0.01 is defined in 4, b, ii.
This is scaled by the harmonic number (defined in link 4, c). The increasing index
returns a corresponding increasing index from the index offset table (4, a, iii)
which is subsequently scaled by -1. This increasing negative index offset causes
the index into the surface table to decrease, thus returning successively reduced
magnitudes for successive harmonics.

The index values produced by the index magnitude and index offset (groups 3 and
4) index the index table (0, b)  used to index the surface table (0, a). This top-level
index table is specified as constant unity (table 247), i.e simply preserves the
existing index value.

The output from the surface table is thus two series of declining amplitude
modulation factors which are applied to the default harmonic magnitude (1).

The y orbit is simply const. unity. In the generic exp. decline surface it does not
vary - the terrain is essentially 1-D, consisting of the harmonic magnitudes
generated on the x plane.

Terrain.
Once the relation between the number of harmonics and their relative amplitudes
has been established, as above, the rolloff rate of the harmonics can be simply
set by adjusting the value of the x axis component group 4 link scalar (dynamic
links group 4, c). If this is greater than 1 the rolloff is more rapid - higher
harmonics are reduced in amplitude faster. If less than 1 then the rolloff rate is
reduced - higher harmonics have greater amplitude and are consequently more
pronounced.

Interesting combinations of harmonic magnitudes can be obtained by varying the
value of the x axis component group 3 link scalar (dynamic links group 3, c) so this
is either greater or less than unity..

Used as the final terrain layer to produce an exponential decline in amplitude of
increasing harmonics, its terrain mode should be multiplicative, not additive: set

gi<n>aTerrainMode = 1

in the i1 instrument declaration (n is the terrain layer number).

The current terrain layer mode operates on the previous terrain layer, so the layer
mode feature is only applicable to terrain layers > 1. 


ExpDclT
generic: exponential decline in duration with increasing harmonic number

The purpose of this is to provide a decrease in duration of harmonic with increasing
harmonic number. As in the previous example, this terrain component is intended
to be used as a multiplicative layer, i.e. acting across the whole spectrum.

The harmonic number needs to control and index into a table which returns an
decreasing rate of duration for a surface table scan (arbitrarily an exp.).

Note: this is essentially a kludge to work around the lack of a k-rate amplitude
envelope -although the terrain system could be used to achieve this. Another
approach would be to have a separate envelope generator with an amplitude
envelope table constructed from other tables, as in the existing method, but with
those tables specified dynamically using ftgen/gen(24?) and indexing this with a 
variable scan period derived from the product of the note duration and index scan
period index - which gives a normalised index into the note envelope on a per-
harmonic basis. This index is already available in the terrain layer code.

Note: tjhis distorts the output since the harmonics have an exp amp rolloff rather
than having an increased index rate - we can't do this because they would simply
tail off to a constant amplitude of unity, rather than being zero (the terrain for the
first layer being additive not multiplicative).

A phasor is used as index, returning negative values for half the note duration,
so the table value defaults to 1 (location 0) and then gradually declines in sigd
form until the end of the table is reached (at the end of the note).

Note also that the use of -ve indexing via the phasor (243) allows most of the
envelope shape of the harmonic to be preserved - only the part after the index
becomes positive are distorted.

Group 3 scales the index phasor to produce range [-2, 2] to which is added group
4 index offset. The scan period of the index is determined by group 5, a, i and iii,
constant 1, hence the period is the reciprocal of the note duration.

Group 4 index offset adds a value ranging from -1 to 0 as its index ranges from 0
to 1 over the scan period 4, c, iii. modified by the product of the link value of 0.1
and harmonic number (f<0> = 1).

The resultant top-level index has range varying with harmonic number, becoming
more negative as harmonic number increases, as the note starts, which gradually
becomes positive as the magnitude of the index (group 3) is reduced by the
increasing contribution of the (negative) index offset (group 4). By the end of the
note, when the index of the fundamental has reached 1, the higher-order harmonics
have reached this value progressively earlier.

This indexes the the group 0 index table, here a phasor of range [-1, 1]. As the
index changes, at first, being negative, since the top-leve table wrap is off,
returns an index of -1 until the index becomes positive, which occurs earlier as the
harmonic number increases.

Using gioscs=10 in the default instrument (f0 - f9) and taking the range of iocti
to be 100 (very approximately), we set

m = 1/iocti<max> = 0.01
q = 0
r = 1/gioscs = 0.1

The frequency-linked dynamic index scalar m (TDC 3, a and b) is used to scale the
constant unity output of the index magnitude index (group 3, b) which simply
replicates this value as an index into the index magnitude table (3, a, iii) which
again returns a value in the range [0,1], which value is a minimum when its index
(m*iocti) is 0.5 (since the function is a linear decrease then increase, 1-0-1).

The value of index magnitude returned by group 3 is thus

	2*(|0.5-m*iocti|)+q

since the indexed table is effectively double for index ranges [0,0.5] and [0.5,1]
and consequently the index ranges [0, 0.5] and [0.5] map to actual index values
of [0, 1], i.e. the index value is effectively doubled.

The pitch at which this zero value occurs is thus 5.00.

A harmonic number linked dynamic index offset scalar r (TDC 4, a and c) is used
to scale the constant unity output of the index offset index (group 4, b) which
again replicates this value  as an index into the index offset table (4, a, iii)  which
returns this same value, from which is subtracted the constant value 0.1
(4, a, ii). This index offset returned by group 4 is therefore

	r*h-r	(h = 1, 2, ...)

This last subtraction is necessary since the harmonic number begins at 1 for the
fundamental, f0, which generates an offset of 0.1 for the fundamental and not
zero, which is required for the f0 index to be at the centre of index magnitude
table 232 (hence the inclusion of offset -0.1).

It should be noted that r determines the filter slope (fraction of inter-harmonic
separation h<m>-h<n>). The slope is proportional to the value of r so as r
increases so does the slope, so the full amplitude is reached more rapidly.

The group 3 (index magnitude) and 4 (index offset) values are summed to obtain
the final index.

As the harmonic frequency rises the index magnitude increases
and so the indexed surface table (202) returns an increasing value. This causes
successive harmonics to reproduced at increasingly greater amplitude, i.e. this
operates on the harmonic series as does a high-pass filter on their sum,
producing precisely the same effect

The condition for the index, hence amplitude, to be a minimum, is:

	2*(|0.5-m*iocti|)+q+r*(h-1) = 0

	h = 1, 2, ...

i.e. the index, hence output, values are solely dependent on harmonic number,
for a given pitch, the harmonic amplitude exponentially increasing as the pitch
departs from 5.00, either higher or lower (the shape of the filter slope is
determined by the combination of group 0 magnitude and index tables, 202 and
247).

For example, if the pitch is 5.00 then iocti is 50. For the fundamental, h=1,

	2*(|0.5-0.01*50|)+0.1*1-0.1 = 0

and thus every harmonic above f0 is less attenuated.

If the note pitch is 4.00 then for f0 (h=1)

	2*0.1+0.1*1-0.1 = 0.2

so f0 is not zero but the harmonic series starts at a higher amplitude (and reaches
full amplitude sooner).

e.g for f1:

	2*0.1+0.1*2-0.1 = 0.2+0.1 = 0.3

At pitch 6.00 for f0 we find the magnitude table index to be:

	2*(|0.5-0.01*60|)+0.1*1-0.1 = 0.2 (same as for 4.00 for f0)

and for f1:

	0.2+0.1 = 0.3 (again, as for 4.00 f1)

Filter example for pitch 6.00 if we require f1 and below to be zero: since for f1

2*(|0.5-0.01*60|)+q+0.1*2-0.1 = 0.2+q+0.2-0.1

= 0.3+q

then

q = -0.3

check:

2*(|0.5-0.01*60|)-0.3+0.1*2-0.1 = 0.2-0.3+0.2-0.1 = -0.1+0.1 = 0

Suppose we now require r = 0.5 to achieve a steeper rollof. We recalculate m:

2*(|0.5-m*iocti|)+q+r*(h-1) = 0

|0.5-m*iocti| = (0.1-q-r*(h-1))/2
m*iocti-0.5 = (0.1-q-r*(h-1))/2 = (0.1-0.3-0.5*2-0.5))/2 = -0.35
m*iocti = -0.35+0.5 = 0.15
m = 0.15/60 = 0.0167 approx.

The harmonic amplitude is zero when the top-level table index is 0.5 and so the
characteristic equation is

	n*h-m*iocti-0.5 = 0

Suppose we require the notch frequency to move over a defined pitch range,
for example 6.00 to 8.00, so that f0 is notch-filtered at both pitches

	nh=m*iocti+0.5

if 1) iocti =60 and 2) iocti = 80 then

	nh =m*60+0.5			(1)
	nh = m*80+0.5		(2)

from (1),

	60m = nh-0.5
	m = (nh-0.5)/60

and substituting for m in (2),

	nh = 80(nh-0.5)(1/60)+0.5 = 80/60(nh-0.5)+0.5 = 1.3r(nh-0.5)+0.5
	nh-1.3r*nh = -0.6r+0.5
	-0.3r*nh = -0.16r

if h=1 then

	-0.3r*n = -0.16r
	n = 0.5

and from (1)

	m = (0.5-0.5)/60 = 0

The notch moves from f0 at 6.00 to f0 at 8.00 (i.e. frq-independent hp filter).

Suppose for the same pitches that h=3 and 5 respectively:

	n*3 = m*60+0.5		(1)	
	n*5 = m*80+0.5		(2)

from (1),

	60m = 3n-0.5
	m = (3n-0.5)/60 = 0.05n-0.0083r

in (2)

	5n = (0.05n-0.0083r)*80+0.5 = 4n-0.6r+0.5
	n = -0.16r

and from (1)

	m*60 = 3n-0.5 = -0.5-0.5 = -1
	m = -0.016r

This is a frequency-dependent notch filter which moves from f2 at 6.00 to f4 at
8.00 as required (f0 = h1). Note that the frequency factor is specified as -m, i.e.
0.016r.

Notch repeat rate is 1/r, i.e. alternate harmonics in this example.

With i=-1, j=0, r=0.5 the notches are on f1, f3, ...  whilst if i=1 and j=-1
they are on f0, f2, ...

note the wrap mode is on in both groups 3 and 4.

The output is a minimum when its index is 0.5 (232 at a minimum) so the table is
read at the extreme left postion (0, nearly). The output is a maximum when the
index is 0 or 1.

The index magnitude is given by

	m*iocti+qh

and the index magnitude offset by

	abs(2(rh-int(r(h-1)))-1)

so the index is given by the characteristic equation

	m*iocti+qh+i*abs(2(hr-int(r(h-1)))-1)+j = 0

Given iocti=80, q=0, m=0.01, r=0.5 then for h1, i=1, j=-1 the index is

80*0.01+0+abs(2(0.5-int(0.5(0)))-1)-1

0.8+abs(2(0.5)-1)-1 = 0.8-1 = -0.2

so the amplitude of harmonic 1 (f0) is 0 (nearly: lhs value of table 202 is 0.001)

and for h2

80*0.01+0+1(abs(2(1-int(0.5(1)))-1))-1

0.8+abs(2(1)-1)-1 = 0.8

i.e. 80% of the way up the exp. function, returns amplitude 0.251
and since r=0.5 these values alternate.

For the case where i=1, j=-1 (even harmonics suppressed), we need the index
for h1 to be 0 and that for h2 to be 1 so that f0, 2, ... are suppressed and
f1,3, ... are unchanged:

for h1, abs(2(rh-int(r(h-1)))-1) = 0
for h2, abs(2(rh-int(r(h-1)))-1)  = 1

and we have

h1	m*iocti+q+1*0-1 = 0
	m*iocti+q = 1	(1)
							
h2	m*iocti+2q+1*1-1 = 1
	m*octi+2q = 1		(2)

and subtracting 1 from 2, q=0 and m = 1/iocti = 0.0125

Note that the amplitude is frequency-dependent: values of iocti<80 are
attenuated; if iocti>80, the harmonic magnitudes are unchanged.

frequency-dependent in group 3: offset is min iocti value for cello-arco-ref-1st pp case (0.715). The iocti indexes table 231 (0-1-0) and returns 0 when iocti is 0.715 since the table index is offset by this amount (-0.715). Since the highest iocti, 0.782, the index at ff is 0.782-0.715 = 0.067

Note: the 0.715 is now 0 since we use ampix [0,1] not old dbamp value
