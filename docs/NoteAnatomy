Anatomy of a note.

A note is what happens when some quantity of material has energy imparted to it
over a defined period (the attack phase) and releases at least some of it in
audio range over some subsequent defined period (the decline phase).

The decline phase is typically longer than the attack phase, but depends on the
type of material.

The attack phase has a simple shape (exp., linear, etc); the decline phase may
(and usually does) have a complex shape which may be broadly separated into
decay, sustain and release sub-phases, not all of which may be identifiable or
present.

The attack phase has complex frequency components, is perhaps chaotic, and
usually contains a significant or even dominant amount of noise which typically
reduces with both increasing distance from the nominal note fundamental and
passage of time through the phase.

The decline phase has simple frequency components, particularly during the
sustain sub-phase where spectral decomposition shows nearly steady-state
relative harmonic strengths.

In summary, therefore, a note typically consists of two sections: a simple
attack shape with a complex spectral content and a complex decline shape with a
relatively simple spectral content.
