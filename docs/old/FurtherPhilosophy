It's possible to use Fourier transform to get component amp/frq sine of a 
2D wave. It should also be possible to apply this to a 3D terrain.

Requires decomposition in 2 directions - on the time and frequency axes

If, on the time axis, we get the conventional Fourier depiction of the 
wave shape (its composite harmonic structure evolving with time) as a sum 
of sines of some amp and frq then what do we get on the frequency axis?

Numerically the same, whatever the labels. Result s/b the same - product 
of the sum of the components s/b the terrain.

Whilst a conventional FFT gives the constituent harmonics, we don't 
actually get the component amps/frqs

Does heterodyne analysis give us this?

What we need is the mathematical representation on both axes, time/freq.

t v f - result amp
f v t - result amp

so we get an amp value in both directions.

Hmm.
Since the product of the fns we require is the terrain, and we can obtain 
1 of these as the Fourier sum (time domain), then the other should simply 
be the harmonic peak magnitudes divided by this. Or possibly multiplied by its 
inverse fn.

Anyway, the expression may be extracted from FFT or heterodyne analysis 
since the equation is simply mag<n>*f<n>, n=0, 1,... e.g. 
2*sin(f0)+0.3*sin(f1)_...

In other words, one axis fn is fixed, determined by the FFT analysis, so 
the other is easily calculated.

The complication is that we can do this for a single note but reproducing 
a range at some given constant amplitude requires we know how the peak 
magnitude pattern changes with time. We could then analyse this as a 
<repetitive> pattern except substituting the freq. domain for time.

However, instead of dealing with cycles per sec we have here (cycles? 
amplitude?) per (freq? Hz).
