Possibly the last time, it's running out.

The note index is linear 0-1 over the duration
21 Nov. 2012 - a month before the world' end...

Atk/Dcl indices are 0-1 over the respective part duration
These indices are derived _indirectly_, the index being derived from 
interpolation of max and min fucntions allowing for a non-linear index.
Thes are set to likely extremes, to match min and max projected 
time displacement of harmonics, over the range of n harmonics. This is a 
rough approximation but might work.

Atk index is 0-1 over attack duration (linear) - but this is used to 
index the interpolated atk min and max fns to derive an indirect index 
which, althouygh of the same range and time duration, changes value in a 
nonlinear way, so the entire harmonic construct in the atk or dcl [phase 
is read, but at differnet rates depending on harmonic number (if a rate 
differential is req's - the poiint is, it's available).

This solves the problem of non-coincident derived and synthetic harmonics, 
which we nopw denote envR and envS (harmonics derived from  analysis and 
those synthesised from the base envelope (see the envelope generator).

It is this base envelope which has indirection in atk and dcl phase 
indices. The sustain phase (here including the decya if present) is simply 
lengthened or shortened via the note duration. This has the drawback of 
strecthing the available harmonic information, or of compressing it, to  
fit the note duration (non-atk/ddcl portion). The alternative is to simply 
repeat the information, which maight lead to a repetitive satructure in 
the note when what we aim for is uniqueness of behaviour (within defined 
limits of relation). Duration-invariant modification can be accomplished 
by wave-terrain modification methods, so this is less of a problem 
(although computing the surface/path is still a complicated issue).
