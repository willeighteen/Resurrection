This is develped from the Resurrection tree. Resurrection-rebirth is the 
initial attempt at a gui-controlled version, abandoned due to code-base 
problems afflciting every previous version.

Note that at least one old version of Resurrection has 3-D array indexing: 
it works in this, the casound demo I had fucked up. This is worth 
ferreting out and saving. Don't know which version in the archive. Fairly 
early on when I was experimenting with control methods.

Speaking of which, see the new generic control system in 
GeneralTableIndexMethod, reproduced here. This solves many of the problems 
involved in controlling terrain surface paths.
