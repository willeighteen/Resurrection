If Resurrection.orc is a link to null.sco then the synth operates for the 
duration specified in lifetime.opts.

If Resurrection.sco is a link to an an actual score file then the score 
statements will be executed. The synth will then hang after note 
generation unless instr 99 is called after the last note is completed 
(with some nominal duration to allow for a system call, e.g. 1s). This 
is a 'self-destruct' instrument forcing the csound instance to be killed 
and control returned to the shell.

Noise: use a comb filter? control ilpt (loop time) to get peaks 
distrobuted at note freq intervals? Noise terrain then filter?
