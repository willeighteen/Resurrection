Subsidiary groups (1- 5)
 
group <n> <p> 
	Three sections to each group (1-5):

	a)
		i)	<p> table scalar,				<p>mag
		ii)	<p> offset to table value		<p>off
		iii)	<p> table					<p>tbl

	b)
		i)	<p> index table scalar			<p>ixmag
		ii)	<p> offset to index table value	<p>ixoff
		iii)	<p> index table 				<p>ixtbl
		iv)	<p> index table phase			<p>ixphase

	c)
		i)	<p> table offset				<p>toff
		ii)	<p> table wrap				<p>twrap
		iii)	<p> index table scan period		<p>ixsp
		iv)	<p> index table scan period flag	<p>spflag
		
	n = group number, p = parameter (sections 1-5 'Parameter ID' above).

	The index generated in b) references a(iii)

	Scan period control:
		sp flag	sp	table <n>bi scan frequency
		1		>0	sp/terraindur
		1		<0	sp*notefrq
		0		>0	sp
		0		0	1
		0		<0	1/sp
		-1		>0	terraindur
		-1		<0	1/terraindur

	The index table scan period index scan period variable 5ciii is dependent
	on the index scan period index table 5biii being set to some table other
	than zero or unity.
	
	The terraindur by default is the note duration but may be set to some part
	of this. The giEnvPhase<terrainType><terrainNum> variable refers.


Subsidiary groups (6)

	6.subgroup <n> <p>
	One section to each subgroup (0-5, above)
	i)	index link value				<p>TDCflag
	ii)	index amplitude/frequency scalar	<p>AFTDC
	iii)	index amp/frq scalar offset		<p>AFTDCoff
	iv)	index harmonic number scalar		<p>HTDC
	v)	index operation type			TDCOP<p>

	n = subgroup number, p = parameter (see 'Parameter ID' above).
	
	The subgroup 0 parameters link to the surface / function index generated
	by the parameters specified in groups 1-5.
	
	The subgroup <n> parameters (groups 1 to 5) link to the index generated
	in that group by the parameters specified in b), i-iv and c), iii.

	Five parameters to each group (0-6)
	
	Link value	link type	amp/frq scalar	amp/frq scalar offset	harmonic scalar	opType
	0		none	<irrelevant>	<irrelevant>			<irrelevant>		<0/1>
	1		amp		<n>			<n>					<n>				<0/1>
	2		frq		<n>			<n>					<n>				<0/1>
	3		iafix		<n>			<n>					<n>				<0/1>
	4		1-amp	<n>			<n>					<n>				<0/1>
	5		1-frq		<n>			<n>					<n>				<0/1>

	n = nonzero group index parameter scalar; a zero value turns the link off.
	iafix = composite amp/frq index generated in i90.

	The harmonic number scalar, if nonzero, links to the product of the harmonic
	number scalar, harmonic number and the amp/frq scalar. If the amp/frq scalar
	value is zero, only harmonic number linking is used (providing the link type is
	nonzero: the actual value is irrelevant if only harmonic number linking is
	required).

	By default the link flags are zero, indicating the associated variables
	are not dynamically linked, i.e. the terrain is a static modifier of the harmonics,
	each harmonic receiving the same modulation as dictated by the terrain. Thus
	all harmonics vary at the same rate and by the same amount. The use of the
	link flags to determine dynamic parameter reference is described in a
	subsequent section [insert Section Ref.]

	Note that use of TDCflag 3, AFTDC nonzero and HTDC nonzero does _not_
	result in a vector formed from amplitude, frequency and harmonic number
	since this would  involve further status tests (slow) inside the terrain code.
	Instead it	uses the HTDC as an amp/frq vector scalar. This is inconsistent and
	unsatisfactory.
	
	Note also that the default settings of TDC flag, HTDC and AFTDC zero results
	in a 	scaling of 1 in the appropriate subsection.

	The TDCOP opType flag controls the interaction between AFTDC and HTDC: if
	zero, these are additive, else multiplicative:
	
	0:	harmonic*HTDC+(AFTDC+AFTDCoffset)
	1:	harmonic*HTDC*(AFTDC+AFTDCoffset)


Subsidiary groups (7)

Indirect index scan period control flag
	Group 5 index scan period is determined indirectly by default (flag = 0), so
	the scan period is set from the parameters in group 5 as for the preceding
	groups 1 to 4. If the indirect index scan period control flag is 1 then the
	group 5ciii and 5civ parameters (index table scan period and index table 
	scan period flag) directly determine the the index table scan period (see
	'scan period control' above).
	In this case it should be noted that the scan period determined by the
	settings of 5ciii and 5civ acts as a scalar of the scan period determined by
	the group 5 settings. In order to disable this so that 5ciii and 5civ control
	the index scan period, the magnitude of the output of group 5 should be
	made constant unity, e.g. 5ai = 1, 5aii = 0, 5aiii = 247, so regardless of the
	internal indexing generated in group 5 its output indexes a table returning
	the constant value 1.
	

Surface / function (0)
	This defines an axis component of the terrain. The terrain parameter files
	are in pairs, one each for the x and y axis functions which, when multiplied,
	generate the required terrain surface. The functions should ideally have an
	offset of 1, so the function variation is about this level. The terrain surface
	values (the 'height' of the terrain) are used to modulate a predefined
	harmonic of some multiple of the fundamental frequency f0 (f<n> = 1,2,...),
	so if the terrain height value is zero, the harmonic in question has zero
	amplitude and does not appear in the output.
	
	Functions may start and end with a zero height - this is in fact desirable for
	terrain tesselation, when the index may be a multiple of the allowed range
	[0,1]. An offset should be applied, as above.
	
	There are five surface parameters (group 0):

		Parameter				Value(s)	Parameter ID

		a) surface table			<n>		tbl
		b) surface index table		<n>		ixtbl
		c) surface index table phase	<n>		ixphase
		d) surface table offset		<n>		toff
		e) surface table wrap		<0/1>	twrap
 
	surface table: the number of a table; a range of defaults exists in
	the file 'header.sco'.
	
	surface index table: another table number; points to the position in the
	surface axis function (above) whose value is to be used as the amplitude
	modulation axis component value for some harmonic(s).
	
	surface Index table phase: an offset into the index table, range [0,1] (cycle). This
	allows the table read to be started at some fraction of a cycle from its
	inital phase. The default is 0.
	
	surface table offset: used to begin surface table value lookup at some
	predetermined point.
	
	surface table wrap: if the range of the index exceeds that of the surface
	table ([0,1]) then the index is wrapped to the opposite end of the table, i.e.
	if the wrap mode is on, value 1, an index value of 1.1 would indicate the
	surface value at index 0.1; if the index were -0.1, the value at index 0.9
	would be referenced. By default the wrap is off.

	surface function: the number of an internally defined function generating a
	z (terrain height) from input x and y index values. Specification of a function
	number for a terrain x/y axis component pair in the intrument setup overrides
	any surface table specified (since the x, y outputs of this are interpreted as
	arguments to the function specified).

	<p> off + mag * TDC0 * [(ixoff + ixmag * [-n, n]), [n] IXTBL IXPHASE, ixsp] TBL, TOFF, TWRAP

subsidiary group:

		(2)	   (1)		(4)	      (3)						   (5)

1-5:
	<p> OFF + MAG * TDCn * [(IXOFF +IXMAG * [-n, n]), [n] IXTBL IXPHASE, IXSP] TBL, TOFF, TWRAP

	These are best understood right to left. A parameter <p> is obtained from a
	scaled and offset wrapped or unwrapped, offset, table value which is returned
	by an index generated by an oscillator whose output is the scaled and offset
	value of an index table determined by its scan period and by a specified
	phase (default zero).
	
	The parameters in both cases are indentical excepting case: lower-case
	parameters are variables; upper-case ones are constants (excepting TDC
	values, which are dynamic link scalars).
	
	Thus at toplevel (0) the harmonic modulation value is obtained from
	evaluation of section 0, the lower-case quantities being determined from the
	appropriate sub-section 1 to 5 in the parameter file specification.
